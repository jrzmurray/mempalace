    """Compute the incremental-mining cursor for a Claude Code JSONL
    transcript: the raw line where the trailing exchange began, and which
    physical chunk it first occupies, so a future re-mine of a
    grown/extended session can resume from there instead of reprocessing
    the whole file. This only COMPUTES and STORES the cursor -- nothing
    yet reads or acts on it, so this changes no existing mining behavior.

    ``raw_content`` must be the SAME content the caller already read and
    passed to ``normalize()`` to produce the chunks being filed this
    pass -- not a fresh re-read of the file. A second, independent read
    here could observe a different state of a file that's actively being
    appended to (the exact scenario this feature exists for), producing
    a cursor that describes content different from what was actually
    mined in this pass.

    ``chunk_size``/``min_chunk_size`` must match whatever the caller
    passed to the real ``chunk_exchanges(content, ...)`` call that
    produced ``num_chunks`` -- they're needed here to correctly count how
    many physical chunks the trailing exchange itself occupies (see
    below); a mismatch would silently point the cursor at the wrong
    chunk. Defaults to this module's own ``CHUNK_SIZE``/``MIN_CHUNK_SIZE``
    when omitted, matching ``chunk_exchanges``' own defaults.

    Returns None (no cursor recorded, meaning "no incremental path
    available, full reprocess next time" -- always a safe default) when:
    - there are no chunks to anchor on;
    - the file doesn't parse as Claude Code JSONL specifically (the only
      format currently verified append-only across /compact and /clear;
      every other format falls back to full reprocess, unconditionally,
      by simply never getting a cursor);
    - ``chunk_exchanges`` would fall back to paragraph/character-offset
      chunking for this content (fewer than 3 quoted lines) rather than
      real exchange-pair chunking -- "the last user-role message" has no
      correspondence to "the last chunk" in that mode, so a cursor
      computed here would silently attach wrong position data to an
      unrelated chunk. Mirrors ``chunk_exchanges``' own ``quote_lines >=
      3`` condition exactly, checked against the same parsed transcript
      text, so the two can't silently drift out of sync with each other.

    A long trailing exchange can itself span more than one physical
    chunk (its AI response alone exceeds ``chunk_size``) -- the cursor
    must point at the FIRST of those chunks, not the last, or a future
    incremental re-mine would treat the earlier ones as part of the
    stable, unaffected prefix when they actually belong to the same
    (about-to-be-regenerated) trailing exchange. Found by re-chunking
    just the trailing exchange's own text in isolation (via
    ``_chunk_by_exchange`` directly, not the public dispatcher --  same
    reasoning as above: its own quote-line count is not the right gate
    here) and counting how many chunks that alone produces.

    Scoped to extract_mode="exchange" only for now (the caller does not
    invoke this for "general" mode): chunk_exchanges' one-chunk-per-user-
    turn shape maps directly onto "the last user-role message", but
    general mode's chunking doesn't share that direct correspondence and
    needs its own analysis before it can get the same treatment.

      prefix up to and including the cursor was edited, not purely
      appended to -- the core precondition this whole feature depends on
      was violated for this file);
    - the trailing content, parsed on its own starting exactly at the

      (e.g. the file's tail is mid-write and momentarily has only a lone
      trailing user turn with no response yet -- rare, and always safe
      to fall back on rather than guess at incomplete data).

    When it returns a chunk list, ``chunks[i]["chunk_index"]`` continues
    the SAME global numbering the cursor's originating mine used --
    values start at ``cursor["cursor_chunk_index"]``, not 0 -- so a
    caller can replace exactly the drawers at or after that index
    (delete where chunk_index >= cursor_chunk_index, upsert this list)
    instead of the whole file's drawers.

    Re-chunks via ``_chunk_by_exchange`` directly rather than the public
    ``chunk_exchanges`` dispatcher: the tail slice's OWN quote-line count
    can fall under the exchange-vs-paragraph threshold even when the
    full transcript is well above it (the common case -- growing a
    session by one more exchange adds one '>' line to a slice that has
    at most a couple), which would wrongly switch just the tail to
    paragraph chunking. The append-only-verified precondition already
    establishes that the exchange-pair path applies to this transcript;
    the tail is a suffix of it, not a fresh decision point.

    A malformed ``cursor`` (missing/wrong-typed keys, or not a dict at
    all -- e.g. stored drawer metadata that predates this field or was
    hand-edited) is just another way the preconditions above can fail,
